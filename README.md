## Earthquake Updates App
The Earthquake Updates mobile App delivers real-time updates on recent earthquakes in Nepal. The app employs the USGS API to obtain earthquake updates and displays them in both tabular and map form. You can filter the earthquake data by date and magnitude to customize your viewing experience. In addition, the app displays earthquake details published by the Department of Mines and Geology Nepal, utilizing KImono to generate an API from their website data.
